It allows to apply a function from a wide selection, to transform cartographic data into a layer with meaning. This technic is used in the context of Indexes composed by several criteria (for example when working with AHP or ANP or making vulnerability indexes). It helps to get all layers involved in values between 0 and 1, so the aggregation of criteria can be done. Is recommended to use it as a facilitator tool to extract the knowledge from experts in a certain topic.

The parameters of the functions were adjusted to be small numbers for the purpose of using this tool in participatory workshops. The actual formulas used in transformation are displayed below graph and exported in a json file when results is saved.
